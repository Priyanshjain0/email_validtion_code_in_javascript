Description
_-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Here's a description of the code in bullet points for beginners:

The code prompts the user to enter an email address for validation.
It then stores the entered email in the variable email and calculates the length of the email using emaillen.
The code finds the position of the last dot (.) in the email using dot and the position of the last "@" symbol using hostname.
It checks if the length of the email is at least 11 characters long. If not, it displays an alert saying "email is not fulfilling length 11".
If the length of the email is 11 or more characters, it proceeds to the next checks.
It verifies if there are either 3 or 4 characters after the last dot (.) in the email. If not, it displays an alert saying "after . not allowed more than 3 characters".
If there are 3 or 4 characters after the last dot, it then checks if there are at least 4 characters between the "@" symbol and the last dot. If not, it displays an alert saying "hostname after @ is not valid".
If the email passes all the checks, it prints the number of characters between "@" and the last dot in the console and displays an alert saying "email id valid".
Please note that while this code attempts to validate the email address, it is a basic validation and might not cover all possible valid email formats or prevent all invalid emails from passing through. It is essential to use more robust and well-tested email validation techniques for production applications.

if(emaillen>=11)
{
   
    if(emaillen-dot==4 || emaillen-dot==3 )
    {
        if(dot-hostname>=4 )
        {
            
            console.log(dot-hostname);
            alert("email id valid");

        }
        else
        {
            alert("hotname after @ is not valid")
        }

    }
    else
    {
        alert("after . not allowed more than 3 charactor");
    }

}
else
{
alert("email is not fullfill length 11");
}
